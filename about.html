Still, your presence means a lot to me, and I hope can continue supporting and enjoying your content. Thank you for being you, for sharing your world with us, for never giving up. Happy Birthday, dear Oshi~  ~TanukiMimi11</div>

            <div class="message" id="message5" style="text-align: justify; white-space-collapse: collapse; padding: 4px 16px; display: none;">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Happy Birthday Sweet Hagdroid! ðŸ’™</p>
    <p>I never expected I'd end up in such a great company when I was looking around on YouTube because I wanted to watch a VTuber play Palworld. I really liked the comfy atmosphere and your sense of humor, so I ended up sticking around. In fact, you had such a profound effect on me that I ended up making a Twitch account! I still barely use it outside your channel.</p>
    <p>As you and a few others in the community know, I suffer from severe insomnia, but your sweet voice and comfy streams have put me to sleep more times than I can count, for which you have my eternal gratitude. Then you released that amazing cover, and while I could pretend that only manly tears were shed, in fact I cried like a little <i>beech</i> each and every single time. The combination of your sweet voice and mild variations in the mixing convey your internal struggle really well. To cap this paragraph off, have a fun fact: I consider "sweet voice" to be one of the biggest compliments I can give, and you're among the very few who deserve it!</p>
    <p>Apart from all the great content you've produced and will produce, I'd also like to thank you for the community you've built. I now consider The City my virtual home, where I found friends, and a lot of love and support in general, far more than I think I deserve.</p>
    <p>Finally, thank you for each and every shout out on streams, it means a lot more than you'd think!</p>
