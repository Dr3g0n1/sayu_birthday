    <p style="text-align: center;">Happy Birthday Sayu!</p>
    <p>On this blessed day, I wish you good health, happiness, a peaceful sky over your head, and that all your dreams come true! Its the first birthday of yours that I celebrate with you and the others Sincroknights! And I hope that we all will celebrate your birthday many more times together! \ (^w^)/</p>
    <p>I never understood the concept of Oshi or KamiOshi before discovering you, but I can now say that Sayu Sincronisity is my KamiOshi. I never felt like part of a fandom or community before being welcomed by your community and now I can say that I am a Sincroknight.</p>
    <p>I may not write a lot in chat but I watch all of the streams because you are so fun. I hope to overcome my shyness and write more in chat and to do more for you and your community in the future. Honestly, I even felt very shy about writing this message. (/w\ )  Anyway, I wish you a best birthday ever!</p>
